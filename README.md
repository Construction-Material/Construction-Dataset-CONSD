# Construction-Dataset-CONSD

## Introduction
It is an annotated dataset CONSD through the improved distantly supervised strategy Ont4RE for entity-property relation extraction in the construction industry.

More details about Ont4RE can be referred to another repo [Ontology-for-Relation-Extraction-Ont4RE](https://github.com/Construction-Material/Ontology-for-Relation-Extraction-Ont4RE-)

## Usage
- `corpus.txt` is the file containing sentence pool;
- `corpus_chinese_word_segmentation.txt` is the file containing chinese-segmented sentence pool;
- `CEMO_triples.txt` is the file containing ontological classes;
- `\CONSD` is the annotated sentences using the Ont4RE;
- `\CONSD_rule` is the annotated sentences using the traditional distantly supervised strategy.
